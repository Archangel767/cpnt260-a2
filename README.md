## Code Review
- The worst bug came doge not wanting to live by any rules, and breaking free of his containment when the page was made smaller. Strangely this bug only seemd to occur in VScode, but not codepen.  
- After multiple attempts to try and ajust containers and media queries, I simply added it as a 4th list item which appears to have fixed the issue for now.  
- Going foward I want to use more grid and less media queries, as they makes things considerably more confusing.
